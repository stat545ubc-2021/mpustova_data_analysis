# Data Analysis Margaryta Pustova

The repository was created for mini-data analysis assignments, which are part of the STAT545 course. The repository consist of the following files:

1. **mini-data-analysis-1.Rmd*** containing the analysis of the selected dataset. This file has been developed in response to *Milestone 1* of the Mini Data analysis. In this file, the dataset for the mini analysis was selected (and the reasons for selection were outlines) and initial analysis/exploration was conducted. The code should be run in R.

2. **mini-data-analysis-1.md** containing the response to the *Milestone 1*. This file was created by "knitting" mini-data-analysis-1.Rmd file.
