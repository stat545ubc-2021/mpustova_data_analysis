# Data Analysis Margaryta Pustova

The repository was created for mini-data analysis assignments, which are part of the STAT545 course. The mini-analysis is focused on exploring the dataset from The Government of Canadaâ€™s Historical Hydrometric Database. This dataset contain the information on the minimum and maximum flow that have been recorded each year since 1909 at a specific stream. It includes information on the year, month, day, extreme type (e.g. maximum or minimum), flow value, and associated symbol (e.g. "E" for estimated value). The project aims to further explore the data in this dataset, as well as to pose and answer research questions based on this data.


**The repository consist of the following files:**


1. **mini-data-analysis-1.Rmd*** containing the analysis of the selected dataset. This file has been developed in response to *Milestone 1* of the Mini Data analysis. The code should be run in R. This file contains the following aspects of the data-analysis:

* exploration of several datasets
* justification for the choice of flow_data dataset
* initial exploration of the dataset (including, exploration of the distribution of flow values, number of missing data per variable, and the relation between variables "month" and "flow")
* 4 research questions for future analysis



2. **mini-data-analysis-1.md** containing the response to the *Milestone 1*. This file was created by "knitting" mini-data-analysis-1.Rmd file.



3. **mini-data-analysis-1_files** containing .png files of the figures from the mini-data-analysis-1.md, which allows to correctly display the mini-data-analysis-1.md



4. **mini-data-analysis -2.Rmd** containing further analysis of the selected dataset building on the *Milestone 1*.This file has been developed in response to *Milestone 2* of the Mini Data analysis.The code should be run in R. In this data analysis, I have:

* explored whether maximum and minimum flow events increased in magnitude since 1909
* explored whether annual distribution of the extreme flow events changed over time by comparing 1909-1919 decade and 2010-2018 decade
* explored when the absolute maximum and minimum magnitude of the flow occurred
* explored whether the number of data entries that are estimated, have significant gaps during the day, or have been affected by the presence of ice decreased over time
* summarized the findings
* practiced tidying and untidying data, producing a tidy dataset
* derived new, revised, research questions
* cleaned the dataset, so that it contains the tidy version of data to answer the new research question and does not contain redundant information



5. **mini-data-analysis-2_files** containing .png files of the figures from the mini-data-analysis-2.md, which allows to correctly display the mini-data-analysis-2.md



6. **mini-data-analysis-2.md** containing the response to the *Milestone 2*. This file was created by "knitting" mini-data-analysis-2.Rmd file.
