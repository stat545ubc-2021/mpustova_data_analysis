# Milestone 1

## Brief description.

This folder contains files for Milestone 1 of STAT 545 course, which aimed at exploring various available datasets, selecting a dataset for further analysis, as well as getting familiar with the variables of the dataset and their potential relationships.

This folder contains:
1. **mini-data-analysis-1.Rmd** containing the analysis of the selected dataset. The code should be run in R.

2. **mini-data-analysis-1.md** which is knitted version of the mini-data-analysis-1.Rmd

3. **mini-data-analysis-1_files** containing .png files of the figures from the mini-data-analysis-1.md, which allows to correctly display the mini-data-analysis-1.md


## Detailed description

The dataset that was selected is a **flow_sample** dataset, which consist of data from the Government of Canadaâ€™s Historical Hydrometric Database. Specifically, the dataset shows the record of annual maximum and minimum flow events between 1909 and 2018, for a specific recording station.


In the Milestone1 the following aspects were explored:

* the distribution of flow values *using histogram and density plot*
* the median, interquartile range, maximum, and minimum values of flow depending on the extreme_type variable *using boxplot*
* missing data for each of the variables *using bar graph*
* the relationship between variables "month" and "flow" *using bar graph*. Moreover, two *jitter plots* and *two boxplots* were created to show the relation between month and flow.

Finally, 4 research questions were derived for future data exploration in the subsequent milestones.
